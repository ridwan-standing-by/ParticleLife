 *
 * There are five distinct icon themes: [Filled], [Outlined], [Rounded], [TwoTone], and [Sharp].
 * Each theme contains the same icons, but with a distinct visual style. You should typically
 * choose one theme and use it across your application for consistency. For example, you may want
 * to use a property or a typealias to refer to a specific theme, so it can be accessed in a
 * semantically meaningful way from inside other composables.
 *
 * Icons maintain the same names defined by Material, but with their snake_case name converted to
 * PascalCase. For example: add_alarm becomes AddAlarm.
 *
 * Note: Icons that start with a number, such as `360`, are prefixed with a '_', becoming '_360'.
 *
 * To draw an icon, you can use an [androidx.compose.material.Icon]. This component applies tint
 * and provides layout size matching the icon.
 *
 * Note that only the most commonly used icons are provided by default. You can add a dependency on
 * androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended to access every icon, but note that due to
 * the very large size of this dependency you should make sure to use R8 / ProGuard to remove
 * unused icons from your application.
