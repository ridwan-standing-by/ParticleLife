    <string name="time_step_description">Simulation time step multiplier. Lower values lead to higher fidelity but slower simulation, higher values lead to faster simulation with more instability.</string>

    <string name="force_value_range_description">Maximum and minimum values for repulsion/attraction forces between species. Positive values indicate repulsion and negative values indicate attraction.</string>
    <string name="about_particle_simulation">A particle simulation, designed to illustrate life-like behaviour emerging from particles obeying a set of simple rules.</string>
    <string name="about_particle_force_explanation">Each particle exerts a force on other nearby particles, depending on their species (represented by the different colours). This can either be a repulsion or an attraction, and is not necessarily symmetric. For example, species A can be attracted by species B, but species B can be repulsed by species A, which would result in A \"chasing\" B.</string>
    <string name="about_particle_extras">To avoid particles speeding up forever, a global friction is applied that slows particles down. Additionally, all particles repel each other if they get too close for comfort.</string>
    <string name="about_particle_final">Play around with different settings to discover which parameters result in the most \"life-like\" creatures.</string>
